      <h2>The Monk and the Scorpion</h2>
      <p>
        A monk sees a drowning scorpion and reaches out to save it, but the scorpion stings him.
        Undeterred, the monk continues to rescue the scorpion each time it falls into water. When
        asked why he helps the scorpion despite the pain, the monk explains that it's the scorpion's
        nature to sting, just as it is his nature to show compassion.

      <h2>The Salt Doll</h2>
      <p>
        A doll made of salt wants to measure the depths of the ocean. As it enters the water, it dissolves,
        becoming one with the ocean. This story illustrates the idea of dissolving our sense of self and
        merging with the greater whole, reminding us that letting go of ego can lead to healing.

      <h2>The Two Wolves</h2>
      <p>
        An old Cherokee tells his grandson about two wolves fighting within him. One wolf represents anger,
        jealousy, and fear, while the other represents love, compassion, and peace. When the grandson asks
        which wolf will win, the grandfather replies, "The one you feed." This fable reminds us to cultivate
        positive qualities to find inner peace.
